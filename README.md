# MATLAB GUI: Radiation Pattern of Dipole Antennas & Antenna Arrays

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and visualizing the **radiation patterns** of standard **dipole antennas** with varying lengths using the **MATLAB GUI**. In the first part, we design and analyze **short**, **half-wave**, **full-wave**, and **variable-length dipoles**, extracting key characteristics like the **HPBW (Half Power Beamwidth)**. In the second part, we explore various **antenna array** configurations, with an emphasis on **phased antennas**. Parameters such as the number of elements, distances between elements, and phase gradient are varied to study their effect on the radiation pattern. Additionally, we cover special phase patterns like axial, radial, and oblique patterns for **ionospheric reflection**.
